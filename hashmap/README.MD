# LinkedList

## Description

This is a small self-written library implementing a hashmap struct and related functions.
I wrote it so that I can use it in my other C projects.

## Installation

Run the following code, if necessary as root:

```sh
make install
```

The header file will be copied to `/usr/include/` and the library file to `/usr/lib/`.

## Usage

Make sure to `#include <RND_HashMap>` and link with `librnd_hashmap.so` (this is usually
done by passing the `-lrnd_hashmap` flag to the compiler).

## Examples
