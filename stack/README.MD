# Stack

## Description

This is a small self-written library implementing a stack struct and related functions.
I wrote it so that I can use it in my other C projects.

## Installation

Run the following code, if necessary as root:

```sh
make install
```

The header file will be copied to `/usr/include/` and the library file to `/usr/lib/`.

## Usage

Make sure to `#include <RND_Stack.h>` and link with `librnd_stack.so` (this is usually
done by passing the `-lrnd_stack` flag to the compiler).

## Examples

See `example.c` file for basic usage. Refer to the source code for a complete list of functions
and other details.
