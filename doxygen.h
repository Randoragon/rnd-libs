 * @section Documentation Overview
 *
 * @b DISCLAIMER
 * This library is no longer maintained. See
 * https://github.com/randoragon/librnd instead.
 *
 * You are reading the documentation of RND library suite. "RND" is just
 * an abbreviation of my internet name, "Randoragon", and it's a prefix
 * I use for all library/function/variable names in the global scope of
 * my C programs to avoid name collisions.
 *
 * There are a handful of libraries here, as of writing this most of them
 * implement orthodox data structures that every programmer should know
 * (linked lists, queues, stacks, hashmaps, etc.), but some of them may
 * have more specific purpose, for example the RND_Game library lets you
 * (to an extent) simulate OOP programming with just pure C by using a
 * few nifty conventions and structures.
 *
 * Overall, feel free to explore this documentation, I've made sure to
 * make it as straight-forward as possible (you'll need some prior
 * programming experience though).
